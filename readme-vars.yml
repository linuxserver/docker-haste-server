  By default, this container is set up to use [file](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server#file) storage. **Note** that haste-server doesn't support expiration of pastes when using this storage. In order to allow support for this, we have added in cron to the container to expire all pastes once per day give the specified mtime. The default here is 7 days. You can modify this expiration (or disable it) by adjusted the crontab file location at `/config/crontabs/abc`.
